# Other implementations:

Turns out "LazyDogP" was reversing it around the same time i was, writing his own implementation in python, ulthough i beat him to it by 2 days, 
mine was completed on Nov 25, 2020 (sometime before midnight probably, on commit https://github.com/KuromeSan/eCDP-Serial-Code/commit/01a79303ac327262b3bf775bead79afe08821f19#diff-0ec3be893ae87fadc26e30a2add3c130cadf5544df8f2ad66d515b23ca1b3113)

his was completed on  Nov 27, 2020, ulthough he lost the race he didnt know he was competing in but still a good reversing effort,

mine acturally worked like 50% of the time the day before that but im not counting that because it wasnt 100% success.
