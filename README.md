# Other implementations:

-- Python

Turns out "LazyDogP" was reversing it around the same time i was, writing his own implementation in python, ulthough i beat him to it by 2 days, 
mine was completed on Nov 25, 2020 (sometime before midnight probably, on commit https://github.com/KuromeSan/eCDP-Serial-Code/commit/01a79303ac327262b3bf775bead79afe08821f19)

his was completed on  Nov 27, 2020, ulthough he lost the race he didnt know he was competing in but still a good reversing effort,

mine acturally worked like 50% of the time the day before that but im not counting that because it wasnt 100% success.

-- JavaScript 

One of the users on the eCDP Speedrunning discord called "User670" ported the algorithm to JavaScript, based on LazyDogP's version
since python is closer to JS than C is .. so i am now using his version for the Web Interface rather than running my C Code via php exec() 
like i was doing before, its slightly faster, and more secure to do it this way too since i dont risk someone finding a way to break out of the exec()
and run arbitary code.. so yeah.
